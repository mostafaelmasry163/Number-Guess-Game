# Number-Guess-Game
Your game generates a random number and gives only 10 tries for the user to guess that number.\
Get the user input and compare it with the random number.\
Display a hint message to the user in case the user number is smaller or bigger than the random number.\
If the user typed a number out of range(100), display a message that is not allowed and don’t count this as a try.\
If the user typed a number that has been entered before, display a hint message and don’t count this as a try also.\
In case the user entered a correct number within the 10 tries, display a congratulations message and let your application guesses another random number with the remaining number of tries.\
If the user finished all his tries, display a message to ask him if he wants to play again or not.\
Next time the user open the game , he receives a welcome message tells him the number of games he played, how many times he won and how many he lost.
